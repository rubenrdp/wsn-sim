# wsn-sim
A routing-layer wireless sensor network simulator

This is a discrete-event simulation environment in Matlab(R). The simulator enables multiple simultaneous transmissions from various data sources as well as the presence of various local adversaries moving in the field. The simulator obviates the low-level communication problems (e.g., collisions) and focuses on the application and routing layers since our goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of CALP scheme [1].
