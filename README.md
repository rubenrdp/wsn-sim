# wsn-sim
A routing-layer wireless sensor network simulator

This simulator was designed for the specific task of validating the Context-Aware Source-Location Privacy (CALP) scheme [1], which is a routing algorithm for preventing a mobile adversary from determining the location of the data sources in a WSN.
